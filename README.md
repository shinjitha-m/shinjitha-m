### Hello world! ![wave](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29372948-62f2-4980-9018-93f4053863fd)
- I'm _**Shinjitha**_, exploring the art of software engineering from London, UK. 

- As a degree apprentice, I'm fascinated by the crucial _**role of Technology within Financial Services**_ - whether it be in large-scale, high-impact solutions or low-latency, high-performance computing - such as that in trading plants.

- I'm currently working on full-stack development and automation!   

- Outside work, I'm interested in Carnatic music, badminton and video games. 

**Happy to connect!**
